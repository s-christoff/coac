When I first arrived in Austin I decided to change myself, and challenge my fears.</p><p name="6e1c" id="6e1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This year I accomplished a lot! I gained the courage to take members of my workplace’s R&amp;D team out to lunch so I could becoming acquainted with them. All these amazing Engineers, which I first thought of as these god-like figures, turned into regular people with bad humor and a lot of knowledge. This helped me start to overcome some of my crippling anxieties. Although there we plenty of nights in tears worried about if I said something wrong, or whether or not they liked me, those nights are now less frequent.</p><p name="2446" id="2446" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was not able to go to college for Computer Science, as I once hoped. Instead of shutting down at this roadblock, I made my own college for myself. This helped me learn about who I am, and how I learn best. Even though it’s still a challenge to focus, I can see myself making progress. I still have so much more to learn though. I wouldn’t be able to do this without the help of all the friends and mentors I have supporting me. I love the saying “It takes a community to raise a child”, because right now I’m that child (and that’s okay).</p><figure name="d838" id="d838" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 503px; max-height: 796px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 158.29999999999998%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-Fzay3yPtTJgO0qrplJ12A.png" data-width="503" data-height="796" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-Fzay3yPtTJgO0qrplJ12A.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: Sarah Andersen</figcaption></figure><p name="c2b0" id="c2b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For 2018 here is what I’m going to focus on:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="11d0" id="11d0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I am going to stop stressing about that silly comment I made while tipsy, or if I stuttered through a sentence.

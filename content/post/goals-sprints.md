I would highly recommend you get a Safari Books subscription, if you haven‚Äôt already.</p><figure name="6291" id="6291" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 165px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 55.00000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*rDIdXeCpoMG58_F-.gif" data-width="300" data-height="165" data-external-src="https://catonacomputer.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/giphy-300x165.gif" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rDIdXeCpoMG58_F-.gif"></div></figure><p name="2e91" id="2e91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I didn‚Äôt accomplish much in my studies due to a hospitalization. However, I‚Äôm happy to be back out in the real world and it‚Äôs time to get back on my game.</p><p name="6e80" id="6e80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I would not recommend allergic reactions, they make your hand do something like this:</p><figure name="0e4a" id="0e4a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 290px; max-height: 300px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 103.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*n2T47qfblPAisUzv.png" data-width="290" data-height="300" data-external-src="https://catonacomputer.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Sarah_Christoff___thatsarahchristoff__‚Ä¢_Instagram_photos_and_videos_üîá-290x300.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*n2T47qfblPAisUzv.png"></div></figure><p name="8dc3" id="8dc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This week I‚Äôve starting ripping apart Terraform to see how I could deploy my infrastructure in the way I‚Äôve configured it. I‚Äôm quickly finding roadblocks, like how any changes to certain files or resources will cause Terraform to rip down your entire Google Cloud cluster and rebuild it. The solution to that problem being to use Kubernetes so when I do a deploy that would effect a cluster then Kubernetes will move all the pods to another cluster, then move it back. It sounds all good in theory, we‚Äôll see how Kubernetes actually handles it soon. I‚Äôm also coming across more realizations as I go, like will Jenkins be it‚Äôs own stand-alone instance, or should I have it somewhere else? How do I deploy kubernetes with a working service mesh (and can I even do that?). I still have a lot more studying and learning to go.</p><p name="f71c" id="f71c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I also spent a lot of time trying to build a game plan for how I will continue my learning. If I‚Äôm not going to go to college right now, I still want some type of structure to abide by. After doing some reading, I‚Äôve found that goals can deter or discourage people due to setting unachievable goals and missing the target. I read up on Sprints, which is where you get a learning period (a couple months) and then you have a month to reflect, and you continuously do this. I also tried to make my structure as close to the Agile Workflow as possible, even though my knowledge of it is lacking. I‚Äôve only read a couple chapters in a book about it, however I know it will be used heavily throughout my career so I should familiar used to it‚Äôs structure.</p><figure name="bd33" id="bd33" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 225px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*bOmt0k7ndwRV2PU6.jpg" data-width="300" data-height="225" data-external-src="https://catonacomputer.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/agile-300x225.jpg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bOmt0k7ndwRV2PU6.jpg"></div></figure><p name="a93d" id="a93d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Off of that above image, which the key thing I take is to constantly re-evaluate, I came up with this:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f97e" id="f97e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Each Learning Sprint will be Four Months in Total (Example: Beginning August‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEnd of November)</li><li name="bbaa" id="bbaa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Each Learning Sprint will have monthly re-evaluations to identify struggles, issues with methodology, and ways to fix anything that may have hindered progress to create a continuous development cycle.</li><li name="acea" id="acea" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Every week a ‚ÄúWeekly Wrap Up‚Äù blog post will be made to discuss challenges, progress, or other misc. things</li><li name="ee05" id="ee05" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Every week should compromise of one group activity, one social activity, two mentor sessions, and consistent working on projects.</li></ul><p name="6281" id="6281" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Since I already have two mentors (and constantly looking for more) so that part is easy, thinking of mentoring sessions as classes. Each mentor session we accomplish covering a topic, and then I usually request to be assigned some work, a challenge, that I can complete until we meet up next week. Right now, I‚Äôm working on building a Turing Machine with one mentor, and learning DevOps tools with another.</p><p name="ce17" id="ce17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The group activity can be anything from going to a meet up (Women in Tech, Kubernetes) or going to the meet up I‚Äôve been hosting, called Noobs Group. Noobs Group is my way of forcing myself to get out of the house and actually work on projects, since sometimes at home it is easy to find other chores and things to work on. So far, I‚Äôve been encouraging the other members to bring up topics they would like to learn about, and then in my free time (whenever that may be) I‚Äôll research that topic, whether on Safari Books or taking a class, then we can cover it in the group. Hopefully this will expand my knowledge in other subjects.</p><p name="f167" id="f167" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The social activity is where things get fun, and I‚Äôve been attempting to take one person out from my company‚Äôs R&amp;D department to see where they started, what they like, and how they got to where they are now. It has been providing me with some groundwork on what to do, what not to do, and best practices to get where I‚Äôm going.</p><p name="da64" id="da64" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I‚Äôm sure this ‚Äúfake college‚Äù structure I came up with will need reworking down the road, but for right now I‚Äôm learning a lot.</p><p name="15c7" id="15c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, GitHub! (<a href="https://github.com/s-christoff" data-href="https://github.com/s-christoff" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/s-christoff</a>). I‚Äôm still very much figuring out GitHub, Git, and my own project. But, I hope I‚Äôll eventually have something worth while to contribute. Currently there‚Äôs only one project, and it‚Äôs my terraform configuration.</p><p name="0567" id="0567" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Questions this week:</p><p name="fbc0" id="fbc0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What is Consul? (How can it be used, why do people use it, is it useful, what tools are it‚Äôs competitors?)</p><p name="e3d5" id="e3d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Also, what is Docker Compose, why does it need to work with Kubernetes, why not just use Kubernetes in the first place?
